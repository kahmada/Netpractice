# Netpractice
This project is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.


About the Project
The NetPractice project is designed to provide students with practical experience in:

Understanding IP addressing (IPv4 and IPv6).
Subnetting and subnet masks.
Basic routing principles.
Analyzing and troubleshooting network configurations.
This project prepares students for real-world networking scenarios by simulating problems and requiring solutions that adhere to standard networking principles.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, students will:

Understand the structure of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
Perform subnetting and calculate subnet masks.
Analyze routing tables and understand how routers forward packets.
Troubleshoot network configurations and resolve connectivity issues.
Use logical reasoning to solve complex networking problems.
